## Benchmark Methodology

### Testing Approach

1. **Multiple Runs**: Each benchmark runs 5 times, average reported
2. **Identical Bytecode**: All runtimes execute the same WASM files
3. **End-to-End Timing**: Includes startup, execution, and cleanup
4. **System Noise**: Multiple runs help average out system variations
5. **Fair Comparison**: Same system, same conditions, same workloads

### Measurement Tools

- **Python benchmark**: Uses `time.time()` for precise microsecond timing
- **Shell benchmark**: Uses `hyperfine` (if available) or `/usr/bin/time`
- **AOT benchmarks**: Measures compilation time separately from execution

### Test Environment

Benchmarks are typically run on:
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- **CPU**: Modern x86_64 processors
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Optimizations**: Release builds (`-Doptimize=ReleaseFast`)

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce these benchmarks on your system:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clpi/wx.git
cd wx

# 2. Build wx with optimizations
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

# 3. Install comparison runtimes (optional)
curl https://get.wasmer.io -sSfL | sh
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSfL | bash

# 4. Run benchmarks
cd bench && python3 benchmark.py
```

Your results may vary based on:
- CPU architecture and speed
- System load
- Operating system
- Runtime versions
- Compiler optimizations

## Performance Goals

wx aims to be:
- **Faster** than wasmer and wasmtime on short-running programs
- **Faster** compilation than wasmer and wasmtime (AOT mode)
- **Competitive** with wasmer and wasmtime on long-running programs
- **Smaller** binary size than wasmer and wasmtime
- **Simpler** codebase with zero external dependencies

## Contributing Benchmarks

We welcome new benchmark contributions! To add a benchmark:

1. Create a WAT or Rust/C source file
2. Compile to WASM
3. Place in `bench/wasm/` directory
4. Run `python3 benchmark.py` to verify
5. Submit a PR with your benchmark

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Real-World Performance

While micro-benchmarks are useful for comparing specific operations, real-world performance depends on your workload:

- **CLI tools**: wx excels due to minimal startup overhead
- **Batch processing**: wx's fast compilation and execution help
- **Long-running services**: wasmtime/wasmer may be better (mature JIT)
- **Embedded systems**: wx's tiny size and zero dependencies shine
- **AOT deployment**: wx provides fastest compilation

Choose the runtime that best fits your use case!
